lon,lat :     -47.127913,-4.490824
age range :   4, 17, 19, also some nearby NaNs (non-overlapping)
biomass range: 120-ish
notes: difficult to see any changes in this area from planet, even for the 4-year recovery moment.
Some nearby is classified as primary forest.
The whole area is clearly affected by substantial deforestation. However in this spot the tree cover looks real and continuous.

biomass range: 88-ish
notes: Looks like there is repeatedly encroaching and receding agriculture. It's also a bit tricky to tell -- in December the whole area is relatively green though you can see later that the area is not forested. There does appear to be continuous tree cover in this location in all planet imagery. Many of the surrounding pixels are classified as non-forest. This makes sense actually given the changes we're seeing and how close the encroaching other land use is.
